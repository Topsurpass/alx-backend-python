# Context Managers and Asynchronous programming in python

## Context Managers: Managing Resources with the with Statement

Context managers in Python ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, typically using the with statement. This is especially useful for handling file operations, network connections, or locks.

### Key Concepts:

Class-based Context Managers: Implemented using **enter**and **exit** methods.
Context Manager using contextlib: A more succinct way to create context managers using decorators and generator functions.

## Asynchronous Programming: Implementing Async Functions and Coroutines

Asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking code execution, enabling tasks to run concurrently. Pythonâ€™s asyncio library provides tools to write asynchronous code using async and await keywords, making it suitable for IO-bound tasks like web servers and network communication.

### Key Concepts:

Coroutines: Functions defined with async def that can be paused and resumed.
** Event Loop**: Manages the execution of coroutines and other asynchronous tasks.
Concurrency with asyncio: Running multiple coroutines concurrently without multithreading.
